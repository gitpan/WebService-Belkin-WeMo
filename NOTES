[Services]

Services are fully defined in the setup.xml, but here's a brief list:

* urn:Belkin:service:WiFiSetup:1
* urn:Belkin:service:timesync:1
* urn:Belkin:service:basicevent:1
* urn:Belkin:service:firmwareupdate:1
* urn:Belkin:service:rules:1
* urn:Belkin:service:metainfo:1
*urn:Belkin:service:remoteaccess:1

Note that this library currently supports some services under basicevent. It woulnd't take too much effort to add
other services as needed.

[Debugging]

GUPnP (https://live.gnome.org/GUPnP/) is highly useful for browsing the UPNP capabilities and even invoking some commands.
